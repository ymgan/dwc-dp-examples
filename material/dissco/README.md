# DiSSCo test dataset for the DwC-DP publishing model

This dataset has been automatically generated from the DiSSCo test dataset, which is available at https://dev.dissco.tech/ (the DiSSCo test environment).
DiSSCo created classes based on the Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) model.
We collect data from our own environment, parse it to DwC-DP classes and deduplicate it.
We then export the classes to zipped csv-files and store the result.
For any new identifiers we use the MD-5 hash of the class.

The generation of DwC-DP files for DiSSCo data will become available in DiSSCover in the furure.
DiSSCo will also implement a DwC-DP download for all datasets provided to DiSSCo.
