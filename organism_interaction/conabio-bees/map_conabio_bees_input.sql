-- For this dataset, every record in input/ecoab-occurrences.csv represents a 
-- MaterialEntity and an Occurrence. The occurrenceID in ecoab-occurrences best 
-- represents a materialEntityID, as it is constructed from a Darwin Core triplet.
-- Generate Event eventIDs based on the MaterialEntities. These events will be reused
-- between material, occurrence, and organism_interaction.

-- Before beginning, make the capitalization consistent on occurrenceID and resourceID in the 
-- ecoab_interaction_data table.
